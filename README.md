# MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Stack App for Task Tracking

## Summary
This application is a simple Tasks Tracking web app, following the MERN tech-stack. Management of tasks is a universal problem, which provided a low-barrier domain of entry as I set out to learn about the MERN technology stack. 

I originally followed the following guide to setup the application, as I began my journey of learning how to develop following this pattern: [Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building a MERN Stack Application from Scratch](https://medium.com/@sriram.se21/step-by-step-tutorial-building-a-mern-stack-application-from-scratch-d281010715e4)

This gave me an introduction to MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. From here, I wanted to make the application my own, so I added the following functionality:
 - [x] Allow Deletion of Tasks
 - [x] Allow Editing of Tasks
 - [x] Add Date and Status fields
 - [x] Add Traditional User Sign-In and Authentication
 - [x] Add User Sign-In and Authentication with Google
 - [ ] Add Settings Per User
 - [ ] Allow for Tasks to be assigned to Users
